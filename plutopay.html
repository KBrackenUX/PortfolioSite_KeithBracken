                            A fresh new way to transfer money
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            PlutoPay is a digital services application that provides instant money transfers, the ability to buy cryptocurrency and has a built-in rewards system.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    With the emergence of technology in the last fifty years, the world of buying and selling has changed. We have shifted to a world where more transactions happen online without the need for a cash, and now in the last few
                    years with the innovation of the cell phone there is less need for a physical bank card. We live in a world where the amount of online sales and transactions is skyrocketing every year, consumers have adopted different
                    models of purchasing goods including subscription services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We enjoy making online purchases for multiple reasons. From cost and convenience, to security, and for a good amount of people we understand that our time is the most valuable resource - so people will be happy
                    purchasing goods and services online for the foreseeable future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But now we have to continue to innovate how we conduct business. This brings up many questions that need to be addressed. Can we trust a device and company to store our banking information? How can we continue to
                    innovate this technology to be used wherever in the world? With the emergence of cryptocurrencies, will the world be using multiple forms of currency to buy and sell goods?
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The user needs a way to be able to transfer and buy products and services easily as well as be able to add others who use multiple different apps, banking services, and currencies because as the world changes more to
                    digital payments and currencies, users need a reliable app to be able to transfer and receive funds whenever they need to.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The first version of PlutoPay will allow the user to transfer and receive funds from their contacts, buy and sell cryptocurrency and send referral links to earn cash and rewards for inviting their friends to use
                    PlutoPay. These features are the most important for growing the service and keeping the users engaged.
                </p>

                    <h2>Market Research</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The first thing to do is to do research on the digital payment services market. This phase will help me understand what users are currently using in the market and who my target audience will be for PlutoPay's digital
                    payment services. The best thing to do is setup some goals prior to doing any research.<br />

                    Consumer Trends<br />
                    While digital methods, such as digital or mobile wallets, have become more common, the number of credit cards does not seem to be declining significantly. This is in part due to the fact that these wallets use a credit
                    or debit card to facilitate the transactions. As such, these payment methods are likely to remain common, at least in this capacity. The purely digital options, known as cryptocurrencies, are currently constrained by
                    such factors as lack of governmental supervision or lengthy transaction times, keeping them from becoming more popular.<br />
                    In 2023, near-field-communications or other contactless technologies are projected to generate over 220 billion U.S. dollars in transaction value. As of 2018, about 25.3 percent of smartphone users in the United States
                    were actively using proximity mobile payment services. In 2020, digital / mobile wallets and credit cards were the most popular payment methods for e-commerce transactions among online shoppers in the United States, each
                    accounting for roughly 30 percent of the total payment count. Ranking third, the debit card was also popular option for e-commerce payments with a share of about 20 percent.<br />
                    Demographics<br />
                    Mobile payments users—consumers who have made an online or point-of-sale purchase, paid a bill, or sent or received money using a Web browser, text message, or app on a smartphone—are more likely than nonusers to be
                    millennials or Generation Xers, live in metropolitan areas, and have bank accounts and college or postgraduate degrees. Of these demographic categories, age is the most predictive of mobile payments use, particularly as
                    it relates to smartphone ownership.<br />
                    72% of Mobile Payments Users Are Millennials or Generation Xers Mobile payments user status by generation, compared with the total population​<br />
                    Millennials and Gen Xers in particular are motivated to use mobile payments in part because they like receiving rewards, discounts, alerts, and electronic receipts. Consumers are also interested in avoiding fees, such as
                    overdraft or check cashing fees, and using their smartphones to help them budget. In fact, research shows that consumers are using smartphones to help with budgeting more than in previous years.

                </div>
                <p>
                    One of my favorite things to do with UX Design is doing a deep dive on other companies and putting together a competitive analysis. I analyzed two direct competitors in the digital payment services industry to better
                    understand what’s working and what isn’t working. My analysis of these competitors includes: Overview, Key Objectives, Overall Strategy, Market Advantage and SWOT analysis. To view the full competitive analysis click

                    <p>
                        The next step would be to collect some qualitative and quantitative research. I conducted a survey through Google Forms, and then after I will have a better understanding of how to formulate interview questions for a
                        select group of users. I created an interview script that informed the participants what the interview process is like. I found five participants to yield useful patterns, trends, critical details, and new insights.
                        I needed to focus on asking the right questions and try to remove any questions that contain any bias related or closed ended questions. I want the users to speak as freely as they can about what I ask.<br />
                        Survey & Interview Research Goals<br />
                        Understand how people feel about making purchases online<br />
                        Understand what features people are looking for in a financial app<br />
                        How people are transferring money to someone or between their own accounts<br />

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        I needed a way to visualize all the research I have gathered - so I created an affinity map to identify trends, insights, behaviors, and themes. It's helpful because we can further delve into more detailed questions
                        in these areas in the next round of research.

                        With all the information gathered up to this point - it's time to create a user persona! A user persona is a fictional but realistic portrayal of our target user, I wanted to create someone who felt realistic and
                        someone who I could design everything with her in mind.<br />
                        Let’s meet Nicole, a 33-year old Project Manager who lives in New York, NY. She's a career driven mom who enjoys taking her family to random fun spots in NYC.

                    <p>
                        To empathize with my user persona ‘Nicole’ - I created a user journey to get a visual understanding of what a typical night out with a friend might look like for my persona to accomplish a goal. In the scenario
                        below, Nicole went out with her friend for dinner - she needs to transfer funds from her bank to PlutoPay and then invite her friend to receive a reward bonus. She is going to use that credit to pay for a bit of the
                        bill and add the cost of the dinner to her monthly budget. Below I have identified the actions, emotions and thoughts of what my persona might encounter and possible opportunities to address these issues.

                    <p>
                        I wanted to get a better understanding of my users' point of view, I created a user flow to think through the different decisions and paths they might take to complete a task. By creating user flows - this helped in
                        identifying what screens would be needed for each step that my user takes. I created three user flows that my persona Nicole will be using throughout her PlutoPay experience.

                        This is where I needed to get an idea of how the information architecture of PlutoPay would be. I started laying out the framework of the app by creating a preliminary sitemap and evaluating these ideas by conducting
                        a hybrid card sort. I chose to use participants who were very familiar with digital payment services for this card sort. Participants were asked to first review a list of cards and then sort them into groups that
                        made sense to the them. The information gathered solidified how the sitemap would work for PlutoPay.

                        After reviewing the hybrid card sort, and taking into consideration the similarity matrix and the dendrogram information - I organized the sitemap for PlutoPay. I wanted to have a way for users to learn what PlutoPay
                        could offer them with a promotional page. After the user logged in, the new Homepage would give the user a more personalized experience.

                        Sketches After completing the sitemap, I began to design the main screens that I identified in my user flow by sketching low-fidelity wireframes. My main goal during this phase was to quickly sketch a couple of
                        different solutions based on the research I gathered up to this point. Using pencil and some graph paper - I quickly created and modified different layouts.
                        <br />

                    After deciding the low-fidelity sketches looked good, I created a clickable mid-high fidelity prototype and started to add UI elements to each screen for usability testing to get user feedback on the user flows.

                        Usability Script & Tests<br />
                        ​I absolutely love this portion of UX Design, the testing phase! After creating a mid-fidelity clickable prototype. But, before I started testing my prototype, I created a usability test plan to use to see how users
                        interact with the app and to define what objectives and goals I wanted to achieve by conducting a usability test.
                        <br />
                        The major goal of this study was to assess the learnability of new users interacting with the application for the first time. I observed and measured if users understand the app and if they are able to complete the
                        main functions of the app, as well as how much time it took them to perform each task.<br />
                        I have included the Usability Test Script, link.<br />
                        Scenarios<br />
                        After creating a plan of what I wanted to accomplish and how I was going to measure the results, I conducted a total of six moderated remote and in-person usability tests between June 9th and 12th. Five out of six
                        participants used Zoom and a link to test the prototype via Adobe XD. Everything went very smooth; no connectivity issues and tests were complete in under ten minutes. All participants were in the New York area and
                        all have used multiple different digital payment services in the past.<br />
                        I created four scenarios and tasks for users to test:<br />
                        Scenario 1: You want to try out a new digital payment app that you have been hearing about. After the app is downloaded you have to create an account so you can explore the multiple features the app can offer.<br />
                        Scenario 2: You are out to lunch with a friend, you need to send her $20 for the drinks that she has has bought you, please send her the money.<br />
                        Scenario 3: You have been researching and understanding more about cryptocurrency and you want to use an app that will allow you to send multiple different currencies to contacts. You want to buy Bitcoin because it’s
                        one of the more popular currencies that you have been researching.<br />
                        Scenario 4: Upon deciding that you really enjoy using PlutoPay, you notice you can earn rewards by inviting your friends. Please copy a link to be able to share with your friends.<br />

                    <p>
                        I summarized the results from the usability test by using an affinity map. I separated each participant with a unique color and categorized what I observed during the interview based on observations, positive quotes,
                        negative quotes and errors. After I categorized each participant, I created a rainbow spreadsheet. This helped to organize the information I gathered from the usability tests. I then created a visual pattern of what
                        the major areas were that needed to be changed.

                        After receiving feedback and revisions from the usability tests. I created a first version of a high fidelity mockup. But I needed to run a preference test because to confirm my insights and see how users would feel
                        about both designs. The images on the right are what the final results turned into after performing the preference test.

                        Towards the end of the design process, I wanted to run a preference test. I listened to my users and thought I could do better. Below is a sample of one of the screens that had to change for the better.

                            Designing the user interface was another fun thing for me to work on, I get so happily lost in Figma. Sometimes when you use apps on your phone you fail to really absorb every detail with that app. But now - I
                            find myself looking at every pixel to see how other designers figured out how to solve their specific problems. With this in mind I identified the PlutoPay brand by creating a UI KIT, which includes information
                            such as the color palette, buttons, symbols, forms, tabs and more.

                        PlutoPay was my first real UX case study with Career Foundry - I fell in love with the process. I learned so much and a part of me wants to keep evolving PlutoPay. I am extremely happy with the outcome and even
                        sharing this project with my peers and friends has gave me this huge confidence boost. I cannot wait to take on more projects in the future. I have a great idea for the next project I want to do. But for now - I will
                        continue to read, listen, and watch all the best designers do their thing and continue my learning process.<br />
                        Thank you so much for going through my PlutoPay Case study!
