            <p>
              I’m a UX/UI Designer with a background in marketing and management. I’ve spent the last few years in the movie industry doing everything from premieres, screenings, large stadium to small grassroot events, press junkets and so much more. I noticed there was a need for someone to manage events for multiple studios and marketing companies, so I started my own business. I named the business Rounds in honor of what my friends and I would call visiting everyone in the dorm in college, “Doing the rounds.” I had a ton of fun doing this because it gave me the ability to have more free time in my life. During this time – I worked on myself, I went to the gym, listened to the most influential and motivational speeches I could, I read more books than I imagined I could, and I picked up so many hobbies and passions. When the pandemic hit, everything changed for me – the movie industry came to a halt, and I had to reevaluate what makes me happy with work. I found UX design, and I thought, “I absolutely love the mix of psychology, sociology, technology and creativity!”. I joined Careerfoundry and studied everything UX/UI/Frontend Development for a year now. When I’m not doing UX/UI design, you will most likely find me in the Metropolitan Museum of Art sketching sculptures. I picked up sketching five years ago and it taught me – you really can learn anything if you setup goals and be realistic about them. It’s changed how I view all the other stuff I love in life. I love painting, cooking, baking, hiking, reading, writing, camping, gardening and so many other ‘ings’.
